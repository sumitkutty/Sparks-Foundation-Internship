<br/>

## Project 2: Prediction using Supervised ML. 
### Objective
* This project involved predicting the score of a student gives the number of hours studied. A simple linear regression problem with a small dataset.The objective also included finding the score for 9.25 hrs/day study. The evaluations were done using k-cross validation (5 folds).
* Packages used: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* Metrics Used: R-Squared Score,Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error. <br/>

### Evaluation:
* Average r2 score:  0.9180771341891051<br/>
* Average MAE score:  -5.701180786326049<br/>
* Average MSE score:  -38.4709444297968<br/>
* Average RMSE score:  -5.970137529278324<br/>
